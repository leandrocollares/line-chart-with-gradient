# Line chart with gradient

The interactive line chart shows the Republic of Korea GDP per capita between 1990 and 2017.
 Hovering over data points causes tooltips containing GDP per capita values to appear.

The visualization is implemented with D3.js version 5.7.0. The SVG gradient placed below the line is based on Nadieh Bremer's [tutorial](https://www.creativebloq.com/how-to/boost-d3js-charts-with-svg-gradients).
